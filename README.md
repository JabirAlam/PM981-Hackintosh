# PM981-Hackintosh
macOS EFI for any PC using PM981a/PM981 (you'll have to customize the EFI to make it compatible with your PC.)

⚠️ Caution: This Project is in development release. The EFI may be unstable in some PC's. As PM981 and PM981a are not supported in macOS. I patched the EFI. Please make sure you DONT delete any of the kexts.
Please Backup your data. Please do NOT use MacOS Tahoe Beta, as that is unsupported, it wont work with the PM981, i recommend using macOS Big Sur for this EFI.
